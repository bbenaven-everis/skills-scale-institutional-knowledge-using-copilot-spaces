# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

OctoAcme uses a structured, iterative approach to project delivery that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and data-driven decisions. Our process spans seven key phases: project initiation, planning, execution & tracking, risk management & communication, release & deployment, retrospectives, and continuous improvement. Each phase has defined activities, roles, and artifacts to ensure consistent, repeatable execution across teams.

## Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments for faster feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning from all team members

## Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and strategic direction

## Project Lifecycle

The OctoAcme project lifecycle follows these sequential phases:

1. **Initiation**: Validate business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments and identify dependencies
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, review, and iterate with regular demos
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production with confidence and observability
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and drive improvements

## Process Documentation

Start with the overview and then explore the specific process documents based on your needs:

### Planning & Strategy
- **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** — High-level introduction to OctoAcme's approach, roles, and key artifacts
- **[Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)** — Steps to validate work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan
- **[Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)** — Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog

### Execution & Delivery
- **[Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)** — Day-to-day management of progress, quality gates, and team rhythm
- **[Release & Deployment Guide](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)** — Standardize releases to production with risk reduction and observability

### Risk & Communication
- **[Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)** — Identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies
- **[Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)** — Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

### Reference
- **[Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** — Detailed responsibilities and communication patterns for all project roles

## How to Use These Docs

- **For new projects**: Start with **Project Initiation Guide** to kick off work
- **To set up a delivery plan**: Reference **Project Planning** and the project templates
- **During execution**: Use **Execution & Tracking** for daily team rhythm and quality standards
- **For risk management**: Reference **Risk Management & Communication** throughout the project lifecycle
- **Before release**: Review **Release & Deployment Guide** to ensure safe, observable deployments
- **After milestones**: Run a **Retrospective** to capture improvements and update processes
- **For onboarding**: Start here and explore the linked docs to understand OctoAcme's complete approach

## Key Artifacts

Projects should maintain these artifacts:
- Project Charter / One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog with Acceptance Criteria
- Risk Register (updated weekly)
- Retrospective notes and action items
- Definition of Done

## Communication Cadence

- **Daily**: Team standups (15 min)
- **Weekly**: PM + PdM sync, delivery team syncs, risk reviews
- **Monthly**: Stakeholder updates
- **Per sprint/release**: Demo/Review and Retrospective
- **Ad-hoc**: Escalations as needed
